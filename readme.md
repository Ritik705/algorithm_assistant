##  How It Works

1. User types a question related to algorithms.
2. JavaScript sends the prompt to the LLM via an API call.
3. The LLM processes the prompt and sends a natural language response.
4. The chatbot displays the answer in a user-friendly chat bubble.

# Limitations

-No chat history
-No voice support
-LLM can give incorrect answers
